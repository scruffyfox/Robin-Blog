Hey guys,

v0.3b, we have lift off! We're excited to announce (finally) a new build with like A MILLION new features and fixes.

Firstly, thanks for being patient while we slave away night and day to bring you the best client evar. Your support helps us remember why we wanted to start this project in the first place.

So now a list of the new features.

1. Image posting! - This is VERY new so it might be buggy, and we're using a service called "dumpyourphoto.com" which is a small site, so image hosting is subject to change in the future. Image quality may not be amazing, but it will be getting better as we have more time to test different quality settings.
2. Settings! - We will be adding way more settings in the future, but for now, only popular demand settings such as notifications, sounds, font sizes etc
3. User searching! - Use the search feature to find hash tags and users
4. Massive memory management improvements. Android is a very tough platform to work on because we literally have to cater for over 1500 devices (mostly shit) which means a lot of them come with 256k ram. So we're constantly working our hardest to get the memory managment sorted. (You will most likely have crashes, we are on top of it)
5. Mass backend improvements. Now the code is more solid than ever before, but it can still be better.
6. ADN Link handling. Open links up using the app
7. Hinted buttons! This is a new UX im pushing, basically, any button or option will tell you what it does when you long press on it!
8. Reply all/Reply thread. The button in the action bar replies to everyone in the thread and the reply all button replies to any user mentioned in that one post
10. Better orientation handling
11. Various other small style changes and optimisations.
12. Inline image parrallex ;)

## What's next

Now we have the first (kinda) stable builds done and out of the way, we're planning on spacing out our next builds. At the moment we have released 3 versions in the space of 2 weeks, so from now on (unless its urgent) we will be pushing a new build every 2 weeks.

New features to come:

1. Tablet support
2. More settings. Notification sounds etc etc
3. Native auto refresh when idle (comes with tablet support)
4. Better image preview support
5. Better image viewer support
6. Url shortening
7. Annotations (geo locations, video, music)

Again, many thanks to all of you for helping spread the word of Robin and supporting us throughout.

As always we've worked hard in the (litterally) 48 hours to get all this done for you <3 [buy us a beer! (im all out)](http://rbn.im/beer)
