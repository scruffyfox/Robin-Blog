Hey guys,

We've just updated to version 0.35b. 

Now you're probably wondering "What the fuck? where the hell is 0.4b and why are you taking so long??" firstly, this is only a bridge build. Because the update of 0.3b didnt go as smoothly as I had hoped, there were a gaillion bugs we needed to fix and here we are with them. The reason why it's taking longer than usual is because we are now spacing our builds out more so we dont make these sort of mistakes again (and plus i've just bought the Borderlands 2 DLC), but seriously, we do need to have breaks else we'll go insane and start talking in code.

So now a list of the bug fixes and changes

1. Profile crashing - This has been fixed
2. Memory issues - This is still an on-going battle, but I think this build is a lot better for shittier devices (sorry)
3. Image posting - I'm a novice when it comes to programming. I've only been an Android dev for 2 years and only now have I figgured out how to do proper image handling, and jesus christ is it messy. I'll probably post a blog tutorial or something because there were different outcomes on all 3 of my devices.
4. Better posting experience. You can now post as many posts in the same amount of time without blocking the UI like it was before
5. Minor UX updates such as swiping left on timeline to open menu and swiping right in followers to open user options, Search page shows user results first if you search for `@username` and visaversa for `#hashtag`, you can now click images in posts to open then, and click on replies in a thread to get its options and view its media
6. Better update checker - sometimes would keep telling users there was an update
7. Notifications should now refresh the mentions page properly when clicked

## What's next

We're still adding to our list and there's no 'set in stone' dates for when each of these features will popup but we aim to get these features included

New features to come:

1. Edit profile
1. Tablet support
1. More settings. Notification sounds etc etc
1. Native auto refresh when idle (comes with tablet support)
1. Better image preview support
1. Better image viewer support
1. Url shortening
1. Annotations (geo locations, video, music)
1. Timeline position saving
1. More settings + customisations
1. Smoother scrolling + other optimisations
1. Thread starring
1. Auto complete for users + hashtags

Again, many thanks to all of you for helping spread the word of Robin and supporting us throughout.
