Hey guys,

As you may know, we've just launched version 0.2b of the beta app which has a few updates.

1. Most crashes that have been reported have been fixed
2. Expandable profile bios
3. Muted page not showing users
4. Muted hash tags! No more #connect_4 for me
5. Changed the icon for the reply all button in thread view
6. Improvements to the clickable text in posts
7. Fixed issue with text in between > and < not showing
8. Notification system now supports multiple devices and no longer sends notifications to users logged into previous devices
9. Cleaned up a lot of styling
10. Updated the max width of the navigiation bar (was waaaayyyy too wide for tablets)
11. When reposting a user, if you change the text it now quotes the original post properly
12. Added fades on stuff like avatars and cover images! I like fades.
13. Added user specific time settings for last refreshed time

##What's next

Well we still got bug fixes to do and what not, but in terms of new functionality, currently on our top priority list is

1. Image posting
2. Making the list views as efficent as possible so they dont lagg like hell
3. Annotation support
4. Cool new option interaction for posts

We've worked hard in the (litterally) 48 hours to get all this done for you <3 [buy us a beer!](http://rbn.im/beer)
