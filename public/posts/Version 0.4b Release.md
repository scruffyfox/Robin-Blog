Hey guys,

We've just updated to version 0.4b. 

The at-last build is here, and I think it's the greatest build we've released yet. We decided to re-prioritize some of the features of the app, for example, instead of having a tablet optimised app, we now have multiple account support! (I believe we're the first app to do so?) and it's all thanks to `@paddy` [and his bounty](https://alpha.app.net/paddy/post/1251546) of $50 for multiple account support, and because we like money (plus we also have multiple accounts) we decided to bump it up the list.

Also a quick mention, we have a new icon! check it out, tell us what you think.

Without further adieu here is a list of the bug fixes and changes

1. Multiple account support
1. Thread muting! (Stop receiving notifications for a thread)
1. Reply notifications - Take you directly to the thread with the reply
1. Inline videos
1. KICK ASS inline image scrolling (seriously, took me forever to get it working and its SOOOO much nicer)
1. Support for instagram and Droplr links due to popular demand
1. Location posting! (Still quite early stages so expect bugs)
1. [Completely new notification system!](http://blog.callumtaylor.net/robinnotificationswithrailsandiron)
1. Spinners, spinners everywhere (loading indicators)
1. Cache limiting (currently set at 20MB, will add the setting to change it in future version)
1. Post meta (click menu->more to see all the details about a post)
1. More optimisations and bug fixes

## What's next

So the next major version is 0.5b and we're looking into making this a public beta depending on how well this build goes. We'll still have a private tester group which will be select people chosen by me.

We're still adding to our list and there's no 'set in stone' dates for when each of these features will popup but we aim to get these features included

New features to come:

1. Edit profile
1. Tablet support
1. More settings. Notification sounds etc etc
1. Native auto refresh when idle (comes with tablet support)
1. Better image viewer support
1. Url shortening
1. Annotations (music)
1. More settings + customisations
1. Thread starring
1. Auto complete for users + hashtags
1. Cache limit setting

Again, many thanks to all of you for helping spread the word of Robin and supporting us throughout.

I need more [beer](http://rbn.im/beer) to keep me going. Please help this developer in need.
