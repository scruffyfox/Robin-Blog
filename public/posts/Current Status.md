Hey guys,

This is just a quick post to let you know the current status of Robin and what our plans are for the next few weeks.

As you may already know, we've released our latest major version (0.4b) a couple weeks ago, and swiftly following it, a hotfix build (0.45b) which addressed a lot of the issues in 0.4b.

Right now (due to directory restrictions and growth) we are currently stabalizing Robin to get it ready for submission to Google Play. This will help us out greatly in terms of making sure we still have our foot in the door for competition, and that we get more user's using the app without having to sign up for a mailing list.

We are currently running a 2 tier beta programme, the majority of you are on the private beta (which will soon become public beta) and a very small number of you are part of the pre-launch beta. This pre-launch beta will be changed to private beta once we are live with the app. The pre-launch beta users are hand picked by our staff (me) as we have a good relationship with them on ADN and they have the devices that the majority of the other user's have which helps us nail bugs without having to trial and error with mass testers.

There won't be an update for the next couple weeks while we iron out the common issues happening, so now's the chance to really use the app and break it as much as possible so we can fix them before we go live.

###Feedback

I've created a short survey which would be greatly appreciated if you filled out [here[1]](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/L9H2B8N) which will really help us add to our list what is/isn't working and what we need to do to make Robin even better.

We're on ADN all day, every day and you can mention us at [@scruffyfox](https://alpha.app.net/scruffyfox), [@rp](https://alpha.app.net/rp) or [@robinapp](https://alpha.app.net/robinapp). If something bad happens, like push notifications stop coming through, feel free to email me at [callum@getrob.in](mailto:callum@getrob.in) as if you mention me, I wont get it till the next day ;)

###Open Source

With Robin, we use a lot of open source software and libraries. We also try to do our fair share of open source as well to give back to the community.

Here's a list of libraries we use in our app:

1. [X Library](https://github.com/scruffyfox/X-Library)
1. [Sliding Menu](https://github.com/jfeinstein10/SlidingMenu)
1. [Universal Image Loader](https://github.com/nostra13/Android-Universal-Image-Loader)
1. [Actionbar Sherlock](http://abs.io)
1. [Pull to Refresh](https://github.com/chrisbanes/Android-PullToRefresh)

We also like to give back, I recently open sourced Robin's notification system. You can read the article [here. [2]](http://blog.callumtaylor.net/robinnotificationswithrailsandiron)

We have also decided to put aside a small amount of money each month from donations/income to give back to these libraries to support them as they have supported us.
