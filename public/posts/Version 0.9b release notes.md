Hey guys,

[Click here to download the app](http://rbn.im/store)

Well, it's been a very eventful couple of months regarding the development of Robin. A lot has happened out side of development which has affected it and slowed it down (as said in the [previous blog entry](http://blog.robinapp.net/halfwayupdate))

The current build is a little off what I wanted it to be before the actual update, but i've made comprimises because of the amount of time that has passed since the actual last update. We will obviously update these and continue to improve them as time continues, but I think there is still a good solid change set.

We're also having a sale this month, app is currently Â£1.99 ($2.99) so get it while it lasts!

##Whats next

We're still working on some of the features we had to comprimise on, so they are our top priority.

1. Scroll widget needs more functionality
1. Static widget for users not on ICS or above
1. Drafts box
1. URL Shortening
1. Super secret feature that will completely change the way Robin works (for the better, we promise)

##Other notes

Again, due to the amount of work outside of Robin, development is still slower than normal. But it should pick back up again within the next few weeks. I thank you all for your patience and support.

I've previously said before in another article about who we are and what our goals are etc. As it stands, all sales and income made by the app are distributed between the people working on the probject, i'm not going to reveal how much % each person gets, but there is a 10% reserve on all income which is kept for the project. And what this means is, it is given back to open source libraries and services that we use in Robin. This month, we've donated to [Jeremy Feinstein](http://jeremyfeinstein.com/) for his Sliding Menu Library. Now because the 10% is a *project* reserve, this money also helps fund server and admin costs. So we've had to use the rest of the money to buy a new AWS EC2 and Google Business account so our notification system can be handled properly.

**Please don't forget that Robin is *still* in beta, and is subject to crashes and what not. I am still working very hard on fixing them as they come in.**


##That's all

That's all for this month, thanks for all the support and i'll keep you posted with the next update. Don't forget to rate us in the monthly client feedback form, and rate us on the market place to make Robin more visible!
