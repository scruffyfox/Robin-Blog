Hey guys,

[Click here to download the app](http://rbn.im/store)

Firstly I want to say a **huge** thank you to all of you who bought Robin in its first month of release, and for all of the great feedback you've given.

I've gone through each and every one of your feedback, and while this update might not have what you asked for in it, it is definitely in my list of things to add in the comming weeks.

Secondly, let me give you a run down on what's been going on during the course of January and the first part of February.

##Change log

1. Fixed image uploading to bli.ms
2. Added option to hide the timeline cover image
3. Fixed issue with account being logged out randomly
4. Fixed issue with the stream being cleared when a load fails
5. Added custom notification ringtones
5. Added new settings page 'appearance' which has more specific options
6. Added Jelly Bean standard notification system (sorry anyone pre 4.1, you wont have this luxry update)
7. Added custom quiet hours setting
8. Fixed issue with android beaming not taking a user without the app to the market place
9. Added PM and patter-app room support! - I've globally named this 'channels' and any channel with a padlock is a private message which you can find on Omega. Other channels are patter-app channels and you can find them aswell on patter-app.net
10. Added the ability to swap what account you post from without having to completely change account
11. Added XHigh res icons for phones such as the Nexus 4
12. Decreased the size of pages which means it should load quicker
13. Added German and French translations
14. plus other small UI changes and backend optimisations
15. LED colour is now red (if supported) for notifications
16. Added trending hashtags
17. Toast no longer shows when automatically fetching location in post
18. Location in post can now be disabled
19. Fixed issue with reposted by showing wrong account
20. Added global feed position saving

##Whats next

There's a few things left on my list to do which I didn't get a chance to complete

1. Stream markers - This is the top of my list, believe it or not, is a very tricky API to work with, so I wanted to make sure I didnt rush implementing it.
2. Gif support - Gifs arnt properly supported on Android, so i'm still trying to work out the best way to handle them
3. Large thread paging
4. More tablet optimised layouts
5. Post draft box + scheduled posting
6. Avatar/cover updating
7. Files API integration
8. Dark theme
9. Mute by keyword/client/annotation + timeout option
10. URL Shortening

There's a few things on this list which I chose not to add yet such as the Files API. This is still *extremely* new so is bound to change in the next few weeks. I'm waiting for the API to mature first before integrating it in to the app.

##Other notes

I've previously said before in another article about who we are and what our goals are etc. As it stands, all sales and income made by the app are distributed between the people working on the probject, i'm not going to reveal how much % each person gets, but there is a 10% reserve on all income which is kept for the project. And what this means is, it is given back to open source libraries and services that we use in Robin. This month, the 10% is going to [@kosso](http://alpha.app.net/kosso) for the services and help with his site [bli.ms](http://bli.ms).

You may also have seen that I recently open sourced the way inline images are done in Robin. If you haven't seen it, check it out over at [my blog](http://blog.callumtaylor.net/howidoinlineimagesinrobinjava-android)

##Discount

Robin has also been discounted for the month of Februrary, not because its the shortest month in the year, but because its @scruffyfox and @simpleline's birthday! The app is currently half price, so make sure you get a copy now if you haven't already. Prices will return back to normal on the 1st of March.

##That's all

That's all for this month, thanks for all the support and i'll keep you posted with the next update.
