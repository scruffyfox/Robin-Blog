Hey guys,

Sorry for the delay in release since 0.45b, a lot has happened since then, as you may know, Romain (@rp) can no longer help out with development due to time and personal constraints, but development is still continuing as we want to make the best App.net experience on Android. 

Since the last build, Robin has undergone a complete re-write and I have literally been working every day on this new build to get it out as soon as possible and it's now available to download on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.rob.client). [As I have said before](https://alpha.app.net/robinapp/post/2245073) the new version is much much more stable than the old beta, as some of you may know.

## Whats next

I have a lot planned for the next releases of Robin and I know, as an app, it's a little behind other apps such as Dash or iPhone apps such as Rivr, but it doesn't mean i'm not working just as hard to get these new features out. A lot has been released in the App.Net API which I want to get into Robin as soon as possible, but the sheer lack of time and man power makes it impossible to get these new features out as quick, so you'll have to bare with me.

Currently Robin is **still** in beta, so expect bugs, crashes and things to change. Any problems you can let me know either via [feedback.getrob.in](http://feedback.getrob.in), [callum@getrob.in](mailto:callum@getrob.in), message me via [@scruffyfox](http://alpha.app.net/scruffyfox) or report a bug via [bugs.getrob.in](http://bugs.getrob.in)

## Monetizing

I have decided (and crowd sourced through ideas and feedback) to release Robin as a paid only app as I would rather release the app as paid first time, than free and then remove features users would be used to. I also didn't want the hassle of maintaining 2 separate apps for paid and free. I feel this is the most fair way to keep development happening since I have spent literally a million hours day and night on getting this release out.

Now I know a lot of you will hate me for doing this, but like I said in a previous blog post [here](http://blog.getrob.in/thedirectionwewanttotake), we want to make money from Robin, it's an app we work on in our free time along side our day job. It will be great to hear all of your feedback and thoughts.

Thanks guys, and thanks for all the support you've given us. Continue being awesome. [Beeeeeerrrr](http://rbn.im/beer)
