Hey guys,

As you may know, App.NET is a paid service meaning you have an annual (or monthly) subscription to use the service. As developers, we have an extra fee to have the privilage of using the API. It's not a lot, but noneoftheless.

There's only 3 of us on Team Robin, lets introduce ourselves.

Callum aka @ScruffyFox. Lead Android developer for [3 Sided Cube](http://3sidedcube.com) in Bournemouth, England.

As you can see, we're all full time employees and Robin is our side project. Over the last month and half we've literally been working day and night to get the app rolling and catch up with all our competitors and we hope it was all worth it.

## But what's in it for you guys?

Firstly, the fact that we've created an awesome app for a cool new platform that will hopefully replace the current dying one.

Secondly, we hope to make a bit of money from it! Yes, money. No one likes working for free and money certainally does help us justify the time spent on developing the app.

## How will you guys make money from Robin?

Well, apart from the developer initiative from App.Net, we hope to sell the app on Google play. Now I know exactly how you feel, you've paid for App.Net and now you'll have to pay for Robin, but it wont be a lot, _and_ there will be a free version available. __There will NEVER be ads in any of our apps__. Instead we will limit functionality which will hopefully annoy you enough to buy the full version :)

We plan on selling the app for roughly 99p which feels like a reasonable price. We will also have the option to donate to us to support us even more.

We hope you guys understand and continue to support us. I'll probably go bankrupt by version 1.0 from spending all my money on coffee.
