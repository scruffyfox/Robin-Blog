Hey guys,

[Click here to download the app](http://rbn.im/store)

It's been quite a while since the last update dropped and i've been hard at work on many things in the app, mainly due to the amount of work I have on outside Robin, and other real life stuff such as buying a house which is fun.

***Note:*** Make sure you send any drafts before updating as they will get deleted.

Although it may not look like much has gone into this build, but much of the underlining app has been re-written and optimised for consistency and speed for both the UI side and cache loading in the app.

So far with this update, there has been 1,369 builds, 350 commits out of a total of 3,133 and literally millions of hours of development time.

I will most likely be spending more of my time re-writing large chunks of the app for the next update and because I want to get it right, I will be pacing my development time which means the next update will most likely take the most amount of time than any other update.

##Other mentions

During this time, we have also launched our new designed site, and we have also moved all of our APIs and website endpoints over to https.

One other thing is, I am also dropping support for 2.3 beginning of the next release. The amount of users using the app on 2.3 is just not worth the time to support it (currently at 0.5-1% of users)

##What Robin is

There's been a few things going around which I want to address regarding the app. Robin is an App.net posting and messaging client. Although ADN's API is very versitile and has support for many things such as file management, group messaging and what not, Robin only fills in for one part of the API. This is primarily because with the sheer amount of versitility in the API, it would be very unwise and almost impossible to do everything the API supports in one app, which is why apps like Patter, Ohai, Filez etc exist. So don't be sad or angry if a new feature has been released and it isnt implemented in Robin, because chances are, it's better if it is a seperate product. I want to steer away from the idea that Robin is an "all-in-one" client, because it's very much the opposite.

Another common request I get, is to make a Twitter version of Robin. I've already outlined [**why im not going to any time soon**](http://blog.robinapp.net/whywerenevergoingtotwitter) so please dont waste your time asking.

##Whats next

We're still working on some of the features we had to comprimise on, so they are our top priority.

1. Super secret feature that will completely change the way Robin works (for the better)
1. Scheduled post sending
1. Multiple image posting
1. Updated tablet layout
1. Proper threadding support
1. More widgets

**Please don't forget that Robin is *still* in beta, and is subject to crashes and what not. I am still working very hard on fixing them as they come in.**
