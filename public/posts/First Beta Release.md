Hey guys,

Thanks for being so patient while we slave away night and day to get the first beta release of Robin out to you.

Just some quick notes before you download it, this is the very FIRST beta of the app, there will be bugs, there will be crashes but bare with us because we do have logging in place (will be optional for release, but mandatory for beta) to make sure we can fix those as soon as they come in. 

There will most likely be a new build every few days to fix issues, but will be prioritized. You will receive a push notification with a link to download when one is released.

As it is still beta, we are looking for as much feedback as possible. Anything you think should be or shouldn’t be in the app or something that didn’t work as expected, we want to know. You can either post at us directly, or email us. [@scruffyfox](http://alpha.app.net/scruffyfox), [@rp](http://alpha.app.net/rp), [@simpleline](http://alpha.app.net/simpleline) or callum@getrob.in, romain@getrob.in , damian@getrobin 

Please be paitent with the functionality. We will closly monitor the push notification service as more users use the app, at the moment theres a < 1 minute delay for messages.

Lastly, a list of known issues we’re working on:

1. User profile can be slow to load sometimes
2. List views can be choppy at times
3. Animations don’t look good when you scroll super fast
4. Lists don’t remember position when you leave the app
5. Cant save images from within the app
6. Search looks terrible
7. Empty lists look bad and don't scroll properly
