Hey guys,

[Click here to download the app](http://rbn.im/store)

Well, its been a pretty hectic month. A lot has happened, and a lot been changed in this version of Robin. 

I'd like to firstly thank you all for all your patience with the update, and especially the patience with the issue of the notification system.

Just a quick insight into the notification system: When App.net released the freemium model, the notification server for Robin crashed. It literally killed the server. Once it was rebooted, we needed to create a new system, so for 3 whole days, @scruffyfox worked relentlessly on it and was ready to go baring one issue from Google which kept sending out multiple notifications to a single device, hence why 0.701b hotfix was released. A lot of hard work and late nights (up until 3am working) went into fixing this issue.

Before I dive into the change log, i'd like to take some time to explain the situation here at Robin and what goes on.

Currently as it stands, there is only one developer (@scruffyfox) and a single designer (@simpleline) working on Robin. Both have full time jobs, which means Robin is a side project which gets done in spare time and weekends. Recently @scruffyfox has had to take on overtime at his day job, working weekends, which means development has slowed down slightly. So please please please bare that in mind before getting annoyed with update releases, there is literally only evenings when we can work on Robin, as it stands, @scruffyfox is currently working over 80 hours a week on his day job and Robin, so please cut him some slack.

##Whats next

Because of the nature of time and priorities, some of the stuff I wanted to get in this version didnt make the priority cut, but is still on the table.

1. Post draft box + scheduled posting
1. Gif support - Gifs arnt properly supported on Android, so i'm still trying to work out the best way to handle them
1. Large thread paging
1. More tablet optimised layouts
1. Mute by keyword/client/annotation + timeout option
1. URL Shortening
1. Keyword searching
1. Translate post option


##Other notes

Due to the amount of work load and what not, I plan on doing smaller updates in the future (now that most of the core functionality is in the app) which will most likely include bug fixes and possibly 1 or 2 new features.

I've previously said before in another article about who we are and what our goals are etc. As it stands, all sales and income made by the app are distributed between the people working on the probject, i'm not going to reveal how much % each person gets, but there is a 10% reserve on all income which is kept for the project. And what this means is, it is given back to open source libraries and services that we use in Robin. This month, the 10% is going to [@nanek](http://alpha.app.net/nanek) for the services and help with his service for trending topics, plus a little to [@kosso](http://alpha.app.net/kosso) for last month.

**Please don't forget that Robin is *still* in beta, and is subject to crashes and what not. I am still working very hard on fixing them as they come in.**


##That's all

That's all for this month, thanks for all the support and i'll keep you posted with the next update. Don't forget to rate us in the monthly client feedback form, and rate us on the market place to make Robin more visible!
