It's been a very busy year for us all, even the guys at app.net who have recently celebrated their 1 year online. We've seen a ton of great apps come out of the service including Robin.

This time last year was the very first public release of Robin on Google Play. It's been a really great year and we've learned so much along the way in creating we hope is your favourite App.net client for Android.

Over the course of the year, we've made 11 updates to the app (including hotfixes), we've added countless new features, and made tons of performance tweaks and enhancements. We also released some inside secrets of how we do some stuff in Robin such as the [inline image scrolling](http://blog.callumtaylor.net/howidoinlineimagesinrobinjava-android) plus other [open-source libraries](https://github.com/scruffyfox). We also launched a new version of our [website](https://robinapp.net) and [blog](https://blog.robinapp.net), included SSL as part of our APIs and website, completely re-written our notification system to provide real-time notifications as they come through from app.net (before there was a max 1 minute delay). We've added support for 9 languages, turned down so. many. requests to make a Twitter version and blackberry version (sorry, its just not going to happen!), and [got](http://jamesduffell.co.uk/blog/adn-android-client-robin) [featured](http://www.androidcentral.com/here-s-another-chance-get-appnet-free-account?utm_source=ac&utm_medium=twitter) [in](https://beautifulpixels.com/android/robin-is-a-feature-rich-and-beautiful-app-net-client-for-android/) [many](http://android.appstorm.net/reviews/internet-reviews/let-posts-on-app-net-fly-with-robin/) [tech](http://blogs.denverpost.com/techknowbytes/2013/05/16/app-net-wants-to-power-the-next-generation-of-chat-and-weve-got-invites/10371/) [blogs](http://androidradar.de/robin-for-app-net/) (and hopefully many more to come)

We've also seen some not-so-great stuff happen like the loss of Romain who sadly couldn't help out with development anymore (boo) and the launch of stream markers which as we all know, @scruffyfox loves oh so very much.

##Moving forward

As you may know, starting from the last update, all future updates of Robin will be fore 4.0+ only. If you have the old version installed, it will still work, you just will not receive any updates for future versions of the app. The reason we are doing this is because the amount of users using the app pre ICS is 1-1.5%. This is incredibly low and is just not worth the time in supporting where we could be making much more progress on fixing other bugs or implementing more features in the app.

We are also preparing for version 1.0. Well, I Say 1.0, this will technically be the third re-write of Robin, so will most likely be launched as 3.0. 

We've decided to re-write a bunch of core code in the app which will not only fix all the horrible reoccurring bugs, but will also mean the app is more stable and fluid as ever before. The app will not be a *complete* re-write, but will be massively re-written. The current status of it is pretty good and we will soon be launching an Alpha programme on Google play that will run along side the beta and current live app. The alpha system will be hand selected only as it is very rough around the edges, the beta will still be available to anyone who [applies](http://rbn.im/testing).

##DIP

The DIP that app.net have provided for developers has been a **huge** help in keeping development alive for Robin. Your support every month in rating the app means that we can continue paying for our servers and continue spending our free time (yes, we all have full time jobs as well as working on Robin) on developing the app.

We hope that you continue to support us not only by rating us in the DIP, but by rating us in [Google Play](http://rbn.im/store). This helps us massively gain rank in search results.

Have a good new year!
