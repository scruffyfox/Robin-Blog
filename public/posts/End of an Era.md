Development of Robin has officially stopped. It has been a very interesting 2 years but the time has come to finally put a pin in the development.

The decision wasnt an easy one, and I would love nothing more than to see app.net succeed and my app get be finished and used by thousands of people, but the sheer stress and economic burden that the app had put on me as a *lone* developer was far too much for me to handle and was seriously affecting my mental health, which was one of the major factors in the ending of development.

Unfortunately, what most people don't realise, is that developing an app is not easy as it seems. It takes *hundreds*, if not thousands of man hours and dollars to make an app and get it into a decent state for release. While many people scorn at developers for charging a buck or two for their app, the actual turn over for a developer would put off aspiring developers in to making apps for a living.

Just to give you a quick insight into what I put into Robin over the past 2 years.

. 4130 code commits (an app I make in my day job averages about ~1130 commits)

. Along side working **full time** at a digital agency, I was working evenings **and** weekends on Robin, putting off more important things like family

. Although the DIP helped **immensely** and I have forever greatful that such a programme existed, sales alone do not cover server costs for the push notification system.

I really do hope that app.net finds its feet again and becomes the social platform it should have been from the start, but untill then, I can't afford to put any more development time into Robin. The code will still exist if that day does ever come and I will certainly re-ignite the project.

The push notification server will stay running until at least the end of the year, after which will likely be turned off (note that these costs will be coming out of my own pocket).

The code will not be open sourced, so please don't ask (this is not by choice)

I'd like to thank every who did support me, you guys were awesome.
