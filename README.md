#Robin - Blog

This is the blog source code for http://blog.robinapp.net

##Disclaimer

I do not claim for any of this work to be good, or useful, simply open sourcing it in case other people wish to make use of it.

##How it works

It simply takes any Markdown written file in `public/posts/` and parses them. It uses the last modified date of the file for its post time, and the title for its permalink.

*************

As with the GPL, you may use the code for commercial use, but dont just fork the entire project and re-release it under a different name, that would make you a dick.

If we meet some day, and you find this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a beer in return.
